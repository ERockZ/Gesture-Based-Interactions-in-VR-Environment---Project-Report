\textbf{Abstract}
%This type of input is considered highly flexible, since it is a 3 dimensional  space that users navigate their hand in and also intuitive if appropriate gestures are use as input signals.

In our experiments we focus on gesture recognition as the main input to a VR system.
We compare the \textit{efficiency} of users who are first bound to a specific input method (touch gesture recognition) then to another (hand gesture recognition) of user interface gesture recognition in achieving a specific set of interactions on classical touch surfaces with\cite{2013gesture}

In the first part of this report we sketch the findings of research in the field of VR that compares differetn input modalities.
We then go on to explain the tools we employed to conduct our own experiments.
In the end we present the gathered results and discuss our findings.
